## JuliaBox

JuliaBox is hosted online at
[http://www.juliabox.org/](http://www.juliabox.org). Join our [Mailing
List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-box).

Our goal is to provide the best Julia experience we can. We want to
make it easy for Julia users to run Julia anywhere without too much
fuss. Use Julia through the browser, access lots of processors and
memory, suck in data from anywhere, and have it always accessible
through any device you use so long as it has a browser.

The only constraint is imagination (and server cost).
